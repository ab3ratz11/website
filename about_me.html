<center><h3><b>Short introduction</b></h3></center>
<center><h2>Hi. First off, welcome to my website. 
    You may wonder why it looks like it's from 2007; This is mostly because<BR>
    1) I enjoy this aesthetic and<BR>
    2) I'm not very good at making websites.<BR></h2></center>
<center><h3><b>Social media</b></h3></center>
<center><h2>I'm currently active on YouTube and Discord.<BR>
Sometimes I'm active on Twitter too, but I very rarely check anything on there.<BR>

<center><h5><b>Longer introduction</b></h5></center>
<center><h3>I'm a self-taught programmer from Romania. I'm also a computer enthusiast, <BR>
Both new and old.
The languages I can speak are: English, Română and a bit of русский (I don't understand a lot of words, but I can read it).<BR>
I want to study Computer Science and become an IT Tester or security analyst in the future.
This whole website is mostly just a passion project, and a way for me to test myself. This website isn't really meant to be anything serious.
